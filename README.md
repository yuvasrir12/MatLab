# 🏃‍♀️ Fitness Tracker: Step Counting, Visualization & Activity Classification

## Overview

This MATLAB Live Script (`myfit.mlx`) analyzes fitness tracker data. It demonstrates how to count steps, visualize movement patterns, and classify types of physical activity using MATLAB programming techniques.

## Features

✅ Load and preprocess tracker data from `.mat` files  
📊 Visualize data using MATLAB plots  
🧮 Count steps based on sensor data  
🤖 Classify activities based on thresholds or signal characteristics  
📈 Use Live Script sections and interactivity for learning and exploration

## File Contents

- `myfit.mlx`: Main Live Script with step-by-step analysis, code, output, and visualizations
- `walk.mat`: Sample data of walking
- 'sit.mat' : Sample data of sitting
- 'run.mat': Sample data of running
- 'downstairs.mat': Sample data of walking downstairs

## Sections Covered in Script

1. **Preparing Data**  
   Load sensor data using MATLAB’s `load` function.

2. **Visualizing Sensor Signals**  
   Plot raw sensor signals to identify walking patterns.

3. **Step Counting**  
   Apply algorithms or thresholding to count the number of steps.

4. **Activity Classification**  
   Identify walking vs other activities using classification logic.


## Getting Started

### Requirements

- MATLAB R2018b or later
- Live Editor support
- `walk.mat` data file (from MathWorks examples or custom)

### How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `myfit.mlx`.
3. Open the Live Script and step through the sections interactively.
